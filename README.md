# First steps in ROS (Robot Operating System)

In this repository, I would like to share my experience in learning ROS. There were many tutorials about starting on ROS, but most of them were not so complicated. After working on ROS for only a few months, I have finally started to understand how ROS works and how to have fun with it. In my experience, coding skill has been required that much. However, it is important to have basic algorithm knowledge and understand how the program works. 

ROS fully run on Linux-based operating systems. If you are not familiar with Linux, this [official guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/getting-started.html.en) might help you to get familiarized with it.

## What is ROS?
ROS stands for The Robot Operating System. Operating System is a difficult topic, but ROS is not OS we know, on the other hand, it is a framework for writing programs for robots. ROS consists of tools, libraries, and functions that simplify the complexity of creating robust, general-purpose robot programs.

The following content is the steps how I started working on ROS. 
## Content
* [Installing ROS](./Installation)
* [ROS Basics](./ROS_basics)
* [Creating a workspace](./workspace)
* [Creating, Building and Cloning packages](./pkg)
* [Getting started with Gazebo and rviz](./gazebo_rviz)
* [ROS with robots](./robots)
* [Creating my own ROS program](./coding)


In this repository, I have uploaded only what I have tried and done since I started learning ROS. Therefore, some topics of ROS haven't been covered. To learn more about ROS, the documentation below can be useful.
